# adsabs.alfredworkflow

With the deprecation of the classic SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) search interface,
I wanted to improve my workflow for searching for papers in the astronomy literature. I find
that I generally just want to do author based searches with possible year constraints so I made
this workflow that can be used by [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) to make this fast and
easy.
